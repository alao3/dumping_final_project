## Cleaning Baltimore and Illegal Dumping Trends and Interventions
Illegal trash dumping is a growing problem in Baltimore City--the Department of Housing and Community Development issued almost 1,150 citations for illegal dumping in 2018, however, there isn’t much insight into why this is happening and what we can do about it. We’d like to better understand the trends that help explain illegal dumping in Baltimore City, and explore potential interventions that can help prevent illegal dumping.
